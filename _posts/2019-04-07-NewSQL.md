NewSQL is a way to try and reconcile the increasing neeed for scalability with the [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID_(computer_science)) principles that drive relational tables.
These kind of architechtures (like google spanner) use transaction commits to keep data safe while still keeping high read write volumes, allowing for horizontal scalability(the ability to utilize economies of scale when buying equipment).

Data wrangling, sometimes referred to as data munging, is the process of transforming and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics.

- **Data Wranging:** Preparing data data for a specific purpose. Taking data from its raw state and transforming it to another format.
    **Why is it useful?** Raw data can be difficult to analyze and gain insights from. Transforming it into dataframes, rows, columns,                               arrays, etc. to a more userful format allows it to be more easily manipulated and analyzed.
- **Example** The transformed data can be used in Machine Learning to restructure it so it can be used in a learning algorithm.
   - Acquire the Data

An [Independent Variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables), is a variable that is manipulated in an experiment or model to test it's effect on a [Dependent Variable](https://www.dsglossary.com/d/dependent-variable). In other words, the values of dependent variables *depend* on the values of independent variables. Dependent variables are the outcomes or outputs whose variation is being studied. Independent variables are the causes or inputs, which represent potential reasons for variation.

Heteroscedasticity means unequal scatter. In regression analysis, we talk about heteroscedasticity in the context 
of the residuals or error term. Specifically, heteroscedasticity is a systematic change in the spread of 
the residuals over the range of measured values. Heteroscedasticity is a problem because ordinary least squares (OLS) 
regression assumes that all residuals are drawn from a population that has a constant variance (homoscedasticity).
Heteroscedasticity produces a distinctive fan or cone shape in residual plots.

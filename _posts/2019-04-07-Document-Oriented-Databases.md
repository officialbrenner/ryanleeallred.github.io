Document Oriented Databases like [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) are useful for storing large amounts of data without as many limitations as SQL.  This means it is less persistent and emphasizes availability and volume, making it more scalable than relational databasing.  Use for larger data or quick development.

*NOTE:  MongoDB has added transactions recently, allowing it to make your data more persistent, keeping it useful even compared to more modern database techniques.*

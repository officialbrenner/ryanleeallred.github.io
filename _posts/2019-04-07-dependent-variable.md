A [Dependent Variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables) is a variable that, as the name suggests, depends on other factors (i.e. [Independent Variables](https://www.dsglossary.com/i/independent-variable)). Dependent variables can be thought of as the output or outcome of whatever is being measured in an experiment. Models and experiments are basically systems for testing the effects of independent variables on dependent variables.

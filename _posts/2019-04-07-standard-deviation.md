In statistics, the standard deviation (SD, also represented by the lower case Greek letter sigma Ïƒ or the Latin letter s) is a measure that is used to quantify the amount of [variation](https://www.dsglossary.com/v/variance) or dispersion of a set of data values. A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be close to the [mean](https://www.dsglossary.com/m/mean) (also called the expected value) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values.

A measure of central tendency that can be thought of as the 'middle' observation of sorted observations.

To calculate -
1. Sort list of observations.
2. Eliminate the highest and lowest observation value.
3. Repeat until 2 or fewer numbers remain.
4. If 2 observations remain, the median is calculated as the average of the 2 observations.

A confidence Interval describes how vonfident one is that the parameter exists within the given values.  For instance, if something exists between 1 and 2 with a CI (confidence Interval) of 95%, they are saying that if their model is correct, anytime you get more data to add to it that data feature will lie between 1 and 2 around 95% of the time at **least**.  If it doesnt, you may want to adjust your model!
